Notion Markdown to Anki Converter: Basic (Front and Back) and Cloze Deletion

# Welcome to Noan!

Hey there! Thanks for checking out Noan!

Steps for using:
1. Download all the Python Files
2. Run it from Noan.py!
3. Enjoy!

Steps for converting:

1. Download your Notion page as a Markdown file (three dots to the top right of the page, and then scroll down and click export. Make sure to change the first option to CSV & Markdown)
2. Unzip the file and make sure the .md is out
3. Upload and convert!

Here is the format to follow for Front and Back card:

- You can use toggles or bullet points for front of the card
    - and then a sub bullet point for the back

Here is the format to follow for Cloze Deletion:

- no bullet points (irony of me using bullet points to explain)
- Example: The [Mitochondria] is the (Powerhouse of the Cell).
    - ‘[]’ is the equivalent of {{c1}}
    - ‘()’ is the equivalent of {{c2}}
    - at the end of each cloze sentence, you MUST have a period. and make sure to put each sentence under each other!
    

Important Notes:

- it will upload the file as ‘My Deck’ so please make sure to rename it
- it does not update existing decks, but rest assured it is an update coming soon!
- it will ignore the name of the page!
